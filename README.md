## Problem Definition and Solution

### Problem

There is a need for a better online store focused on just selling Toys in Australia where buyer can shop for new, old or unused one.

- Why online?
- Why within Australia
- What's wrong with the sites that already exist?


#### Why online?
Online shopping cover wider market so there are more buyer and seller. It allows buyer to see photos/videos of a product so they save their time not being phsically there aswell as seller doesn't have go to different marketplace to sell their products.


#### What's wrong with the sites that already exist?

Having already justified a need for an Australian-based two-sided marketplace for preloved books, below is a detailed overview of existing sites selling preloved books within Australia, and why a better solution is needed.

While there are a number of preloved bookshops in existance within Australia,

- they have a physical presence (not online-only)
- they're not a two-sided marketplace, they are one store selling the books

Places do exist for selling preloved books person-to-person online (e.g. Ebay, Gumtree, Fishpond, Amazon), but they're not made specifically for books. The exception to this is several sites made specifically for the buying and selling of textbooks ([Student VIP](https://studentvip.com.au/textbooks); [Dusa Bookshop](http://www.dusabookshop.com.au/2nd-hand-books); [MQ Bookshop](http://www.mqbooks.org/cgi-bin/bookex/bookex.cgi); [Zookal](https://www.zookal.com/)).

One website can be found that has the same premise as this one - an Australian two-sided marketplace for preloved books ([BookEMart](https://books.thebookemart.com/)), however it could be improved in a number of areas:

- Improve overall look of site to be more modern and aesthetically pleasing by following modern design principles
- Improve ease of navigation
- Reduce barrier to entry (enable viewing of books prior to signing up)
- Reduce or eliminate ads, or make them less obtrusive
- Make it exclusively Australian, so that users do not need to worry about whether the books they are looking at are coming from overseas
- Use a database for adding books to increase accuracy of book listing as well as increase ease of use for sellers

### Solution

Create a better online store which are onl focused on toys that can be new/old and unused one.


## User Stories

Preliminary user stories were collected in Trello, with more detailed user stories subsequently created.

## Workflow

The original workflow was conceptualised in the diagram below. Some minor alterations were made during development as needed. These will be reflected in a future version of this diagram.

## Style Guide

Colours and fonts were chosen as below.

![colours](/readme_resources/color_scheme.png)

![fonts](/readme_resources/Fonts.png)

Gentium Book Basic is set at a slightly heavier weight than Gentium basic, and is used for publishing books at small point sizes.

Open Sans was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance. It was optimised for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms.

## Wireframes

Content-first mockups were created using Figma and can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/cHJ5winPhgKShwLn5E3RRi4l/Preloved-Books-Two-Sided-Marketplace).

After revisions necessary for creation of a MVP, the current ERD is as below.

## Trello

Trello was used from the beginning of this project to track ideas and tasks, as well as completion dates.

See this project's [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/UHhZI3Xi/online-book-store) for details.
